# BreezeProject

Included is the final code for the assigned project. It took me a little longer than expected. I guess I'm a little rusty. 

I wrote, compiled, ran, and tested all of this on my DWWD site which is hosted on Hostmonster (www.dwwd.me/breeze). I do not have a local server. 

Given the simplicity of the project, I kept all the files in the main folder. I made use of several libraries to facilitate the different required actions and styling. The only thing I had never done before was the automated testing. Being self-taught and just doing this on my own, I always just did manual testing. So, I did some looking around and came up with the "autotesting.php" file that runs through several possible upload problems and outputs the error code generated. 

I appreciate this opportunity to work with you. As I mentioned in my application, even if you don't want me as a programmer, I would love to help in a consulting fashion since I am a user of the product and I have several features I would like to see added or changed.

Thank you again!

Daniel
